            <p class="proj-descrip"> What's in the name? Classify is a play off the streaming site
                Spotify, by far the industry leader in music streaming (and lets be honest, in music listening
                in general). The ability to listen to your music when you want to is a privilege that can only be afforded
                in today's age of information. The one problem? Spotify has so much information behind the scenes with no
                way to use it directly through the application. Our goal is to give users access to metadata,
                the "hidden" information, so that they can use it to classify, edit, and refine their playlists.
